It worked out great in the first year, started losing its sheen in the second year, and became detrimental to creativity and collaboration by the third year. It failed for us in the most critical areas. We then made the collective decision to switch to a &amp;ldquo;hybrid&amp;rdquo; mode, where about 10% of us involved in creative and decision-making endeavours now come to the office three days a week while 90% of us continue to be fully remote.</description></item><item><title>User disengagement</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/user-disengagement/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/user-disengagement/</guid><description>Over time, I have come to realise that the term user &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; in software, more often than not, is a thinly veiled proxy for user entrapment, whether intentional on the part of software designers or not. The trend of shallow user numbers and &amp;ldquo;engagement&amp;rdquo; metrics taking centre stage in business valuations has created perverse incentives at a massive scale for software to indulge in unethical practices of &amp;ldquo;engaging&amp;rdquo; users at any cost, with no respect for the limited and fast eroding levels of cognitive resources.</description></item><item><title>Scaling with common sense #2: Being future ready.</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/being-future-ready-with-common-sense/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 15:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/being-future-ready-with-common-sense/</guid><description>Over the last year, owing to the unexpected rally in capital markets, Zerodha&amp;rsquo;s customer base has more than tripled, significantly increasing the number of concurrent users on our platforms along with the traffic and load they generate on numerous systems in the background. For context, in January 2020, we were handling 2+ million retail trades daily. In April 2020, it had risen to 7+ million. Today, it goes up to 12+ million.</description></item><item><title>Alar: The making of an open source dictionary</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/alar-the-making-of-an-open-source-dictionary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/alar-the-making-of-an-open-source-dictionary/</guid><description>ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ (Namaskāra)! This is not a post on fintech, or even technology for that matter. This is the story of a product of tenacity, selflessness, and passion; a product that will transcend and outlive most technology we know of. This is the story of a massive dictionary that will become the window to a language spoken by tens of millions of people for generations to come, a resource its author has donated to posterity.</description></item><item><title>Scaling with common sense</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/scaling-with-common-sense/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 14:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/scaling-with-common-sense/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Scaling&amp;rdquo; is not a specific technique but an entire spectrum that stretches all the way from &amp;ldquo;Google scale&amp;rdquo; to the K8s cluster Karan runs on a Raspberry Pi plugged into a 12V shaver outlet in his bathroom to encrypt his DNS queries for peak privacy, while he asks Alexa to dim the lights and play his favorite non-mainstream indie music.
It is a collection of practices unique and intimate to every organisation, and is the product of an infinite number of variables; the numerous domain-specific problems, the structure of the organisation, the nature of the people involved and their biases, countless engineering decisions and trade-offs, technical debt and history, ad infinitum.</description></item><item><title>Hello, World!</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>Zerodha, now India&amp;rsquo;s largest stock broker, bootstrapped and profitable, turns ten years old this year. The Zerodha tech team turns seven years old. The tech team has remained largely elusive over the course of our existence. While we have pondered starting a tech blog for more than half a decade, we have often found ourselves too busy building the fundamental blocks underlying a stock brokerage. We have also been stalled by a sense of unpreparedness to talk to the world about our very unconventional setup.</description></item></channel></rss>

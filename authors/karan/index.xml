Also, we are very particular on self-hosting as many dependencies as possible, everything from CRMs to large databases, Kafka clusters, mail servers etc.
To aid these primary systems, there are a large number of ancillary workloads that run, covering everything from real-time trades, document processing, KYC, and account opening, legal and compliance, complex, large scale P&amp;amp;L and number crunching, and a wide range of backoffice workloads.</description></item></channel></rss>

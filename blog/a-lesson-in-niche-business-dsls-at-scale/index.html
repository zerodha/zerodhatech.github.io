into the system as concurrent high throughput HTTP requests. Each trade
increases the latency for subsequent orders in the queue that are under
processing at the same time at our OMS (Order Management System). When a single
order comes through to the OMS, it goes through a bunch of computationally
intensive validations and adds to the latency. To reduce the latency of orders,
we decided to offload some of these business validations from the OMS into an
external component called Veto, which pre-validates incoming orders based on
custom dynamic rules set by our Risk Management team. Rejected orders never go
through to the OMS thereby reducing significant load on the OMS. This is the
story of how we incrementally built this engine to keep up with the changing
business and regulatory environment starting with a custom DSL (Domain Specific
Language) and ending up with writing a framework to manage rules written in Go
and embedded inside Go plugins.</p><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><p>Our goal with Veto was to build a dynamic evaluation engine framework capable of
hot-reloads. This framework would provide a generic environment to manage, track
and audit rules and filters on an easily accessible dashboard. The engine should
have support for custom data-stores related to the orders. Rules in this
framework are business validations on orders placed by our clients. These
validations range from simple checks like validating the limit prices to be
within circuit limits, to complex beasts, which <a href=https://support.zerodha.com/category/trading-and-markets/kite-web-and-mobile/articles/why-did-my-bank-nifty-option-order-get-rejected>validate fresh buy
orders</a>
in Nifty/BankNifty strikes due to exchange OI restrictions.</p><p><img src=/static/images/bnf-veto-rejection.png alt=banknifty-rejection-example></p><p>Our first solution utilized our research from the
<a href=https://sentinel.zerodha.com/>Sentinel</a> project. We combined
<a href=https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate>knetic/govaluate</a>, which is an expression
evaluation engine, along with a filter manager and a hot reload mechanism with
an HTTP server which would either respond with an appropriate rejection to
the incoming order or proxy to the upstream OMS, thereby acting as a reverse
proxy with validations. The expression language was similar to Excel formulas,
which was familiar to our RMS Team that managed and operated it through custom
management dashboard built using <a href=https://frappe.io/>Frappe/ERPNext</a>.</p><h2 id=problems-with-dsls>Problems with DSLs</h2><p>After taking it live, we realized a bunch of issues that
cropped up and became pain points for us over time. These were not really technical,
but more or less, human usability issues.</p><ul><li><p>Since the underlying engine was a simple expression evaluator, the operators
would end up spending hours trying to write complex rules, and similarly the
developers, who are supposed to approve the rule to be production ready, spent
time reviewing it.</p><ul><li><p>This was due to how unreadable the expressions would become beyond a certain
complexity. Simple rules were indeed faster to write, but anything beyond
it would be beyond human capability to comprehend, which would cause
unnecessary and difficult debugging sessions in the office.</p></li><li><p>Unlike a regular language with branching, the operator writing the
rule would be stuck on writing logic defined with bracket matching
and <code>AND/OR</code> statements. Also, missing support for variables would not
allow us to reuse values.</p></li><li><p>To write a single complex rule, operators would depend on writing the rules
into manageable chunks. For example, a single spread (shown below) the rule would be broken
into <code>spread_ce_buy</code>, <code>spread_ce_sell</code>, <code>spread_pe_buy</code>, <code>spread_pe_sell</code>
rules.</p><p><img src=/static/images/veto-govaluate-example.png alt="Veto Govaluate Sample"></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Custom error messages and any non-boolean behaviour were not possible, as the
expression can only evaluate to a boolean. Switching to a proper language, we
could use early returns in the rule and return custom messages alongside the
evaluation result.</p></li><li><p>Implementing new functions and adding new variables was a pain.</p><ul><li>This meant that if you were to add a new function, you would have to bundle
it within the engine, defeating the purpose of the rules being dynamic.</li><li>This also meant the developer had to always be involved in writing the rules, defying the whole purpose of having a DSL for business folks.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=new-beginnings>New beginnings</h2><p>Our learnings from these issues made us reflect if it would be worth it for the
operators to keep using a simple expression language. The way we were going, we were
essentially building a DSL (Domain Specific Language) on top of <code>govaluate</code>,
that would keep getting more complex with time.</p><p>We finally decided that a solution to the problem was to use Go-like language as
the DSL instead of <code>govalute</code> and distribute the dynamic rules as Go plugins, as
Veto was written in Go in the first place, just like the rest of the Kite stack.
It is simple, easy to learn, and has good tooling around it.</p><p>We debated heavily on the best approach to solve the problems that we were
facing with veto rules and shortlisted a few candidates. We picked a complex rule in production written using govaluate and wrote that in the following to benchmark the performance of the rules in the alternatives.</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate>Govaluate</a> - evaluates arbitrary C-like expressions</li><li><a href=https://github.com/containous/yaegi>Yaegi</a> - embedded go interpreter</li><li><a href=https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/>Rego</a> - open-policy-agent DSL</li><li><a href=https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin>Hashicorp Plugins</a> - plugin system over RPC.</li><li><a href=https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/>go-plugins</a> - native go plugins</li></ul><p>Benchmark Results:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>govaluate:

</code></pre></div><p>We considered govaluate to be the baseline for our experiments. In our
benchmarks, native plugins outperformed other solutions and brought the power of
the entire Go runtime into independent plugins. We discarded Hashicorp plugins,
as they were slower. Yaegi was nice, but not as fast as govaluate. Govaluate and
Yaegi provide a simpler way to distribute rules, when compared to native plugins
which need a bit of orchestration.</p><h2 id=veto-v2>Veto v2</h2><p>Considering all the facts, we decided to go ahead with native Go plugins. They
are as fast as native code once loaded, and given enough tooling, act just like
regular Go code, along with all its niceties like type safety and none of the
baggage of other alternatives.</p><p>Veto v2 would be a web server which loads rules from native Go plugins on boot
and behave like a reverse proxy accepting incoming orders as HTTP requests,
either rejecting them in place or proxying them to the upstream OMS.</p><p>Since there are
<a href=#overcoming-go-plugin-caveats>problems</a> associated with building and
distributing plugins due to dependency issues, requiring in-tree building and
compilation, we decided to first work on writing a framework to abstract the
caveats associated with go plugins.</p><h3 id=a-framework-for-writing-rules>A framework for writing rules</h3><p>Rules in Veto v2 are now written in plain Go by the operators. A rule looks similar
to the following sample rule.</p><p>Each rule is expected to provide three functions.</p><p>Rules are contained in the <code>Validate</code> functions that are expected to accept an
interface and return a <code>rule.Result</code>. The contexts contain the controllers and
data needed for validating the rule, and are passed by the host to the rule
manager which iterates over all the rules. The host can then interpret the result
and do what it needs to, in our case render a response to the user with a custom
message, or proxy to the upstream.</p><p>Another added benefit of having written a custom go plugin based framework for
rules, is that we can implement our own testing framework for validation of the
rules. Every rule is expected to return its own testcases as a
<code>map[interface{}]e.Result</code> where the interface is the context. This way if a
rule implements all the testcases, we are sure that any minor refactor will be
also correct in the future. This reduces the need for constant developer
oversight and the testing needed for the rules. Also, the testcases provide
extra documentation for the future.</p><p>The following rule contains a sample circuit limit rule for illustration.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=color:#719e07>package</span> main

there hasn’t been much development on the feature recently. The <a href=https://github.com/golang/go/commits/master/src/plugin/plugin.go>commit
history</a> shows
us that the last major commit happened nearly 2 years ago. On the gopher slack,
the sentiment, more or less, is that this is not a priority anymore. Along with
this, there are multiple issues that come up with maintaining projects that use
it:</p><ul><li>The Go version for both host program and plugin should match exactly.</li><li>External dependencies should match.</li><li>Host and plugin GOPATH needs to exactly match while building.</li><li>Plugins cannot depend on interfaces or structs of the host without in-tree building.</li><li>Plugins can’t be un-loaded after they have been loaded by the host.</li><li>An exactly same plugin cannot be loaded again by the host.</li></ul><p>To learn more you can read <a href=https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20481#issuecomment-326832200>this
issue</a>
summarising some of the problems with go plugins.</p><p>Plugins works well if the projects bundles all the plugins in its own source
tree and both the host and plugins are built together at the same time. But,
that might limit the scope of a project. Externally maintained plugins are near
to impossible to build independent of the host program.</p><h4 id=building-rules>Building rules</h4><p>To solve the issues listed above, we can use Docker to build both the host
program and our custom plugins together. Using Docker, we are able to use
emulated paths. This image also contains the source code of the host program.
This image allows us to build and load the plugins separately from different
machines, such as our CI/CD pipeline or a rule compiler as described further
down the post.</p><p>In practice, we prepend the following <code>dockerCommands</code>, so that the
paths to the <code>go build</code> command.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=color:#586e75>// Commands for locally testing with docker. Prepended to buildCommands

</code></pre></div><h4 id=compiling-rules>Compiling rules</h4><p>To combine multiple rules into a single plugin, we introduce the concept
internal to our project called <em>Compilation</em>. A compilation step is similar to the
build step, but combines multiple <code>.go</code> rule files which are stored in a folder
into a single <code>.so</code> plugin.</p><p>The compilation command expects a folder containing the source code of all the
rules, and the <code>description.go</code> which contains the meta information about what
would be available in the <code>rule.so</code> file. It utilizes the build steps described
in the section above, but adds pre-processing steps that help avoid a few of the
Go plugin caveats.</p><p>As per our framework, every rule is expected to provide three functions to
compile. These are in turn used by the validation pre-process to verify the
rule.</p><p>Plugins can export any kind of data and functions from their source. Since,
multiple rules need to export the same function, while compiling all the rules
into the plugin, we traverse through the AST and modify the function names and
prefix the rule name.</p><p><code>AddPrefixToSource</code> is a function that prefixes the rule name onto the functions
so they can be uniquely found when we load the plugin. For example, a rule with
slug as <code>a_sample_rule</code> will be available in the plugin as

becomes a problem when we try to reload a plugin. This function makes the

</code></pre></div><h3 id=dashboard-for-the-operators>Dashboard for the operators</h3><p><img src=/static//images/frappe-veto.png alt=frappe-veto-dashboard></p><p>We connect two services with our admin dashboard implemented in <a href=https://frappe.io>Frappe</a>
where the operators can edit the rules. This panel has a built in editor, where
the operator can edit the rules, validate it, and if it passes the test cases,
it is saved to the database.</p><p>These are backed by two small deployments which run in an internal K8s instance
with the validation and compiler veto servers.</p><p>The validation server has a handler which expects the rule source as a post
param. It adds a constant with the current unix timestamp to the source and
builds and validates the rule. If it passes, it returns <code>true</code> via an HTTP
response. In case of a failure, it records the stdout and responds with why it
failed, including the full Go build log, helping the operators know what
happened.</p><p>Our compiler server is responsible for listening on an endpoint for a post
request which initiates a sync with the admin panel and then runs the compile
rules routine on the folder and builds the plugin in the appropriate mock
folder. Then we push this built plugin to our production veto instance and issue
a hot-reload.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The major lesson here is that DSLs are complicated and clever choices can become
human usability bottlenecks in the long run. Excel like familiarity in the
expressions might let operators write and manage rules with ease, but becomes a
pain overnight as the business rules and their complexities start growing out of
control. A language like Go, which is simple, reliable, and efficient, is easier
to learn for the operator than a custom DSL, and the sheer extensibility for the
developer. Trusting non-tech folks to learn Go instead of investing in learning
a custom DSL is a viable alternative that we have been able to successfully
implement at India&rsquo;s largest stock broker. Writing a framework that abstracts
the annoying caveats of an under-loved feature like Go plugins, to enable
dynamic loading of Go functions to act as rules, is useful, considering the
tangible benefits it presents when compared to writing custom DSLs.</p><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/golang>golang</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer><a href=https://zerodha.com>Zerodha</a> &copy; 2024.

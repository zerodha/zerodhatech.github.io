This is not a post on fintech, or even technology for that matter. This is the story of a product of tenacity, selflessness, and passion; a product that will transcend and outlive most technology we know of. This is the story of a massive dictionary that will become the window to a language spoken by tens of millions of people for generations to come, a resource its author has donated to posterity.</description></item><item><title>Scaling with common sense</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/scaling-with-common-sense/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 14:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/scaling-with-common-sense/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Scaling&amp;rdquo; is not a specific technique but an entire spectrum that stretches all the way from &amp;ldquo;Google scale&amp;rdquo; to the K8s cluster Karan runs on a Raspberry Pi plugged into a 12V shaver outlet in his bathroom to encrypt his DNS queries for peak privacy, while he asks Alexa to dim the lights and play his favorite non-mainstream indie music.
It is a collection of practices unique and intimate to every organisation, and is the product of an infinite number of variables; the numerous domain-specific problems, the structure of the organisation, the nature of the people involved and their biases, countless engineering decisions and trade-offs, technical debt and history, ad infinitum.</description></item><item><title>Infrastructure monitoring with Prometheus at Zerodha</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/infra-monitoring-at-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/infra-monitoring-at-zerodha/</guid><description>On any given day, we handle around 15% of daily retail trading volume across all stock exchanges in India. Billions of requests generated in the process are handled by a suite of systems we have built in-house. Also, we are very particular on self-hosting as many dependencies as possible, everything from CRMs to large databases, Kafka clusters, mail servers etc.
To aid these primary systems, there are a large number of ancillary workloads that run, covering everything from real-time trades, document processing, KYC, and account opening, legal and compliance, complex, large scale P&amp;amp;L and number crunching, and a wide range of backoffice workloads.</description></item><item><title>Hello, World!</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/blog/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/blog/hello-world/</guid><description>Zerodha, now India&amp;rsquo;s largest stock broker, bootstrapped and profitable, turns ten years old this year. The Zerodha tech team turns seven years old. The tech team has remained largely elusive over the course of our existence. While we have pondered starting a tech blog for more than half a decade, we have often found ourselves too busy building the fundamental blocks underlying a stock brokerage. We have also been stalled by a sense of unpreparedness to talk to the world about our very unconventional setup.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://zerodha.tech/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zerodha.tech/projects/</guid><description>FOSS projects out of Zerodha.
